The Marsh Trail is teeming with life. Rabbits are frequently seen scurrying off the trail, while dragonflies swoop over the water, and birds flit among the willows growing near the creek. Due to the abundance of water, flowering plants have an especially long season here. The Marsh Trail connects the Rancho del Oso Nature and History Center to the Ranger Station by a bridge over Waddell Creek.
